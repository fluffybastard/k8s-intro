## Introduction to K8s

### Requirements
* Docker
* Virtual box ( or similar hypervisor )
* Minikube

### Start the local cluster
`$ minikube start` : this will take some time

### Check that the service is actually running
```bash
$ minikube version
``` 
: you should see something similar to this : `minikube version: v0.35.0`
